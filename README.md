# Simplified 2-Point Move Command in Rhino3D

Enhance your Rhino3D workflow with a custom script that streamlines the traditional Move command by allowing a more intuitive two-point selection method. This script is designed to improve precision and speed, especially when working with heavy models.

## What is the 2-Point Move?

The **2-Point Move** command lets you move objects by specifying two points directly in the viewport:

- **Base Point**: The starting point from which the move originates.
- **Target Point**: The destination point where you want the objects to be moved.

This method mimics the natural way we think about moving objects in physical spaceâ€”by picking them up from one spot and placing them in another.

## The Problem with the Traditional Move Command

When using Rhino's standard Move command on heavy models, you might notice a significant slowdown. This is because the command provides a real-time preview of the selected objects following your cursor as you specify the target point.

## How to Use the Script

### Load the Script in Rhino

**Method 1**:

1. Type `_RunPythonScript` in the command line.
2. Browse to the location where you saved the script and select it.

### Method 1 Creating a Button or Alias for Easy Access (Optional)

If you plan to use this script frequently, you can create a button or an alias for quick access.

#### Creating a Toolbar Button

1. **Right-click** on an empty area of the toolbar and select **New Button**.
2. In the **Button Editor**:

   - **Left Button Command**:
     ```plaintext
     ! _-RunPythonScript "FullPathToYourScript\2pt_move.py"
     ```
     Replace `FullPathToYourScript` with the actual file path where you saved the script.
   - **Tooltip and Help**: Add a description for the button's functionality.
   - **Set an Icon (Optional)**: You can assign an icon to the button for easier identification.

#### Creating an Alias

1. Go to **Tools > Options** and select the **Aliases** tab.
2. **Create a New Alias**:

   - **Alias**: Choose a short command name, e.g., `m2`.
   - **Command Macro**:
     ```plaintext
     _-RunPythonScript "FullPathToYourScript\2pt_move.py"
     ```
     Again, replace `FullPathToYourScript` with the actual path.

3. **Use the Alias**: Type the alias (e.g., `m2`) into the command line and press **Enter** to run the script.


### Using the Command

1. **Select** the objects you want to move.
2. When prompted, **click** to specify the **Base Point**.
3. **Click** again to specify the **Target Point**.
4. The selected objects will move from the base point to the target point.
